# SimpleMessenger

SimpleMessenger app on android enables two android devices to send messages to each other.
The size of the message is assumed to be a maximum of 128 bytes. All communication is over TCP.
This was done as part of coursework for Distributed Systems(CSE586) course offered in UB in spring 2015.
